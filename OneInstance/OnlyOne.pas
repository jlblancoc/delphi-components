	OnlyOne, version 1.00, Freeware
	 A Delphi 2.0 component
	composed by Gary Nielsen, 3/26/96
	 70323.2610@compuserve.com
	
	Drop the OnlyOne component onto a form and only one
	instance of that window will occur.  Any attempt to make
	a second instance will restore the previous window.
	
	caveat artifex:
	 Use this component at your own risk.  OnlyOne may not
	work with applications that change their title bar, or
	with applications that have names longer than 20 chars.
	I have only tested this component on a limited number
	of programs, so treat it as 'alpha'-ware.
	
	Acknowledgements:
	 To make this into a component, I used Steven L. Keyser's
	JustOne component as a template.  I also derived some code
	from PC Mag's Michael J. Mefford's PicAlbum utility,
	in which hPrevInst is used, but, according to the
	documentation, hPrevInst always equals NULL	with Delphi 2
	and Win95.
	
	Please, if you modify or enhance this code,	drop me a
	note so that I can learn from your work.
