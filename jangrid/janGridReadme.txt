Notes to release 4:
TjvStringGrid has been renamed to TjanGrid. The 'jan' prefix is now registered in the www.href.com delphi-prefix register. Because the Grid can also be used as a calculating spreadsheet I have removed the 'String' part of the name.

New features:
1. LoadFromHTML
2. select between A1 and r1c1 style cell references.
3. Cell Names, for easy to read formules.
4. Cell Hints that display both a cell name and a formule.


Installation:

Install janGrid.pas in a new package e.g janGridPack, the other units are automatically imported in the package.


Help:

TjanGrid comes with a detailed Help file.
